But, there was no canvas. So, I clicked for a new canvas, and ... it opened up in another window, with less controls, no clear instructions , and, apparently, no way to choose or change pen / brush styles or sizes or anything, except color. So, I removed it. \n\nMaybe it's me. I don't know! But, I know I learned how to use Corel Photo-Paint, as it advanced through the years since 1993 or whenever it was we got that first one, without reading the instruction manual and it is supposed to be vastly more complicated than this! So, no thank you.",
